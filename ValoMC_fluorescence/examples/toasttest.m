%%  Working with Toast++: toastest.m
%
% This example is based on a simple Toast++ usage example found on the
% Toast++ web site. The original example can be found from
% http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/vis/toast/demo_matlab_fwd1.html. It
% simulates a steady state diffuse optical tomography (DOT)
% measurement in a circular geometry that has 16 detectors and 16
% light sources located on the boundary of the object.
%
% Each source is used to illuminate light into the domain and the
% amount of light is measured at all detectors. This is repeated for
% all source locations. In the example, the measurement matrix (signal
% intensity at each detector) is simulated both with Toast (as in the
% original example) and with ValoMC. Note that the results are not
% equal since Toast uses DA as the model for light propagation. DA
% can be regarded as a good approximation for photon transport in a
% highly scattering medium with distances further than a few
% scattering lengths from the source.
%
% Toast++ is a software for image reconstruction in diffuse optical
% tomography. It contains a forward solver module using the finite
% element method for simulating the propagation of light in highly
% scattering, inhomogeneous biological tissues. The inverse solver
% module uses an iterative, regularized least-squares approach to reconstruct the
% unknown distributions of absorption and scattering coefficients in
% the volume of interest from boundary measurements of transmitted
% light.
%
% Toast++ toolbox is being developed by Martin Schweiger and Simon
% Arridge (University College London) and the copyright of the
% original code belongs to them.

%% Create the geometry
% Create a circular mesh using Toast++ and import it to ValoMC

rad = 25;
nsect = 8;
nring = 34;
nbnd = 2;


[vtx,idx,eltp] = mkcircle(rad,nsect,nring,nbnd);

toastmesh = toastMesh(vtx,idx,eltp);
vmcmesh = importToastMesh(toastmesh);


%% Set the optical coefficients
% Note that the optical coefficients are given for each node in Toast,
% whereas in ValoMC they are uniform values for each element.

% absorption coefficient [1/mm]
mua_bkg = 0.01;  
% scattering coefficient [1/mm]
mus_bkg = 1.0;                   	        
% scattering anisotropy parameter [unitless]
scattering_anisotropy_bkg = 0.0; 	        
% reduced scattering coefficient [1/mm]
mus_reduced = mus_bkg*(1-scattering_anisotropy_bkg); 

% Set optical coefficients for Toast.

nnd = toastmesh.NodeCount;
toast_mua = ones(nnd,1) * mua_bkg;  % absorption coefficient [1/mm]
toast_mus = ones(nnd,1) * mus_reduced; % reduced scattering coefficient [1/mm]

% Set optical coefficients for ValoMC. The refractive index is set but it
% does not affect the solution as there is no mismatch on the boundary.

nne = size(vmcmesh.H,1); % number of elements

% absorption coefficient [1/mm]
vmcmedium.absorption_coefficient = ones(nne,1)*mua_bkg;
 % scattering coefficient [1/mm]
vmcmedium.scattering_coefficient = ones(nne,1)*mus_bkg;
 % refractive index [unitless]
vmcmedium.refractive_index = ones(nne,1)*1;
% scattering anisotropy parameter [unitless]
vmcmedium.scattering_anisotropy = ones(nne,1)*scattering_anisotropy_bkg;

% Create the boundary so that there is no mismatch
vmcboundary = createBoundary(vmcmesh, vmcmedium);

%% Create the source and detector positions
%
% A collimated lightsoure (pencil beam) can be approximated in DA
% by placing an isotropic source at a distance 1/mus' from the surface,
% where mus' is the reduced scattering coefficient.

% Build source/detector locations for Toast

nq = 16;
for ii=1:nq
  phi_q = 2*pi*(ii-1)/nq + pi / 256;
  Q(ii,:) = (rad - 1/mus_reduced) * [cos(phi_q) sin(phi_q)]; % source position
  phi_m = 2*pi*(ii-0.5)/nq + pi / 256;
  M(ii,:) = rad * [cos(phi_m) sin(phi_m)]; % detector position
end

toastmesh.SetQM(Q,M);


% Build source/detector locations for ValoMC

% Sources and detectors are placed to the nearest boundary elements

source_boundary_elements = findBoundaries(vmcmesh, 'location', Q);
detector_boundary_elements = findBoundaries(vmcmesh, 'location', M);


%% Plot the source/detector arrangement
% Note that the lightsources have a finite width in ValoMC, which introduces
% a small discretisation error in the comparison.

%% Solve the FEM system with Toast
% The system matrix is constructed manually using 2D coefficients (by
% default, Toast uses formulas derived from the radiative transfer equation
% for 3D geometry). For more detailed information about 2D and 3D
% coefficients, see e.g. T. Tarvainen: Computational Methods for Light
% Transport in Optical Tomography, PhD thesis, University of Kuopio, 2006.


% Create isotropic sources 
qvec = toastmesh.Qvec('Isotropic','Point');

% To obtain comparable results, the measurement vectors have a sharp
% Gaussian profile (a narrow detector). Conversion factor between fluence
% and exitance is 2/pi in 2D
mvec = 2/pi*toastmesh.Mvec('Gaussian',0.5,0);

% 2D diffusion coefficient
toast_kap = 1./(2.*(toast_mua+toast_mus));

Phi = K\(qvec);                % solve the fluence
Y_toast  = mvec.' * Phi;       % compute the exitance on each detector

%% Solve the photon transport problem with ValoMC
% The source is relocated 16 times and the exitance at each 16 detector is stored
% to build a similar source/detector matrix as in the original example.
