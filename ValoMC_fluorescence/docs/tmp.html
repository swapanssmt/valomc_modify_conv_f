 Runs a photon transport simulation

 USAGE:

       solution = ValoMC(vmcmesh, vmcmedium, vmcboundary)
       solution = ValoMC(vmcmesh, vmcmedium, vmcboundary, vmcoptions)

 DESCRIPTION:

       This main function used to initiate simulations.
       The input structures are documented in more detail
       in the homepage (see below).

 INPUT:

       vmcmesh                   - contains the geometry of the system
         .H                      - element topology
         .BH                     - boundary element topology
         .r                      - node coordinates
       vmcmedium                 - contains the optical properties of the medium
         .absorption_coefficient   all have same size as size(H,1)
         .scattering_coefficient
         .scattering_anisotropy
         .refractive_index
       vmcboundary
         .lightsource            - type of the lightsource (e.g. {'cosinic'}. {'gaussian'})
         .lightsource_direction  - size(H, Ndim)
         .lightsource_direction_type  - {'relative'} or {'absolute'}, direction with respect to normal or an absolute direction

 OPTIONAL INPUT:

       vmcoptions
         .photon_count
         .disable_progressbar    - true or false
         .seed                   - random number generator seed


 OUTPUT:

       output
         .element_fluence         - size(H,1)
         .boundary_exitance       - size(BH,1)
         .seed_used
         .simulation_time

 OPTIONAL OUTPUT:

         .grid_fluece             - per pixel/voxel fluence if the mesh was created using createGridMesh
